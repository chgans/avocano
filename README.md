# Avocano fork

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/avocano.
I'm using it as an experiment to setup my own django powered website.

Changes will focus on:
- Removing the JS client and Firebase, as I'm planing to have a regular Django backend/frontend.
- Enabling the CI features that are specific to the GoogleCloudPlatform project (please release, conventional commit, ...)
- Validation of PR by deploying a project from scratch (see provisioning/automation/)
- Validation of the upgrading the production project
- Maybe more...

Eventually this project will be set as read-only, and I will create my own project from scratch based on what i have achieved with my fork.

Big thank you to the GoogleCloudPlatform team for providing me with a solid base.
